# Section 4: Population Scale Analysis \[HOMEWORK\]

## Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
data <- read.table("https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213_W19/class-material/rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt", header = T)
head(data)
nrow(data)
```
Sample size: 
```{r}
table(data$geno)
```

```{r}
summary(data$exp)
```

# Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative
expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the
expression of ORMDL3? 
It seems like A/A has higher expression than G/G

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```
Making a boxplot: 
```{r}
ggplot(data) + aes(geno, exp, fill =geno) + geom_boxplot(notch = T)
```
